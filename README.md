# Personal Website
This is a repo for my [personal website](https://ked.wtf/), built using the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

## Build
Clone the repo and run `npm install`. Once dependencies are installed, run `npm run build`. The built files will now be in the `public` directory.

## Local Development
`cd` into the repo and run `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`. This will build and launch the site on a local server which will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/`. Changes made locally will automatically trigger a rebuild.
