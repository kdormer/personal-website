It's been a while since I updated this website but for good reason. After much hard work, I am beyond pleased to announce that I recently attained a first-class degree in Computing at the University of Gloucestershire! Four years of hard graft have finally paid off and, if truth be told, it's a very satisfying feeling.

What's more, I recently landed a job as a junior backend developer. Even in the few short weeks since I've been working I've learned so much in terms of how to write better code. With this in mind, I certainly look forward to what the future holds.

Now that university is out of the way I think some new goals are in order. My current career goal is to keep improving as a developer and gain enough experience and expertise to become a mid-level developer. Outside of work, I am training to run a half-marathon, reading through the works of Dostoyevsky and making use of my newfound free time after graduating to get out into the great outdoors more again.
